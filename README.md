# aaronflask

Made this by coding along with a YouTube Flask Blog App tutorial. This is not an advanced guide,
but it should at least get one up and running with Flask. 

One should have Python, basics and minimal html, css knowledge, and a coding editor to start.

Flask tutorial less than 3 hours:
