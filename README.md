# aaronflask

Made this by coding along with a YouTube Flask Blog App tutorial.
This is not an advanced guide, but it should at least get one up and running with Flask. 

One can improvise and get a pythonic website up and running.

Requirements: Python, basics and minimal html, css knowledge, and a coding editor to start.

Flask tutorial in less than 3 hours:
